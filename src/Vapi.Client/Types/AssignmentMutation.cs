    /// You can reference any variable in the context of the current block execution (step):
    ///
    /// - "output.your-property-name" for current step's output
    /// - "your-step-name.output.your-property-name" for another step's output (in the same workflow; read caveat #1)
    /// - "your-block-name.output.your-property-name" for another block's output (in the same workflow; read caveat #2)
    /// - "global.your-property-name" for the global context
    ///
    /// This needs to be the key path of the variable. If you use {{}}, it'll dereference that to the value of the variable before assignment. This can be useful if the path is dynamic. Example:
    ///
    /// - "global.{{my-tool-call-step.output.my-key-name}}"
    ///
    /// You can also string interpolate multiple variables to get the key name:
    ///
    /// - "global.{{my-tool-call-step.output.my-key-name-suffix}}-{{my-tool-call-step.output.my-key-name}}"
    ///
    /// The path to the new variable is created if it doesn't exist. Example:
    ///
    /// - "global.this-does-not-exist.neither-does-this" will create `this-does-not-exist` object with `neither-does-this` as a key
    ///
    /// Caveats:
    ///
    /// 1. a workflow can execute a step multiple times. example, if a loop is used in the graph. {{stepName.output.propertyName}} will reference the latest usage of the step.
    /// 2. a workflow can execute a block multiple times. example, if a step is called multiple times or if a block is used in multiple steps. {{blockName.output.propertyName}} will reference the latest usage of the block. this liquid variable is just provided for convenience when creating blocks outside of a workflow.
